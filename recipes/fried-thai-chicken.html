    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken:
            <p>In a bowl, combine the minced garlic, chopped cilantro roots, black pepper, and soy sauce. Mix well. Rub this marinade all over the chicken pieces, ensuring they're evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight for maximum flavor.</p>

        </li>

        <li>Prepare the Dredging Mixture:
            <p>In a shallow dish, combine the all-purpose flour, rice flour, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of ingredients.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Coat the Chicken:
            <p> Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large skillet to 350째F (175째C). Dredge each marinated chicken piece in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Place the coated chicken on a plate or wire rack.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Fry the Chicken:
            <p>Carefully lower the chicken pieces into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches if necessary. Fry the chicken until golden brown and crispy, about 10-12 minutes for dark meat pieces and 8-10 minutes for white meat pieces. Make sure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165째F (75째C). Transfer the fried chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Serve:
            <p>Serve the Hat Yai Thai fried chicken hot with sticky rice, sweet chili sauce, and cucumber salad on the side for a delicious and authentic Thai dining experience</p>

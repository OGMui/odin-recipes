    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken:
            <p>In a bowl, combine the thinly sliced chicken with soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. Let it marinate for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Heat the Oil:
            <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Saut√© Garlic and Chilies:
            <p>Add minced garlic and finely chopped Thai bird's eye chilies to the hot oil. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Cook the Chicken:
            <p>Add the marinated chicken to the skillet in a single layer, spreading it out evenly. Let it cook without stirring for 1-2 minutes to allow the chicken to brown slightly on one side.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Stir-fry Chicken:
            <p>Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir-fry the chicken for another 2-3 minutes or until it is cooked through and no longer pink. Break up any large chunks of chicken as it cooks.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Add Thai Basil Leaves:
            <p>Once the chicken is cooked, add fresh Thai basil leaves to the skillet. Stir-fry for an additional 1-2 minutes until the basil leaves are wilted and fragrant.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Adjust Seasoning:
            <p>Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add more soy sauce, fish sauce, or sugar according to your preference for saltiness, umami, or sweetness.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Serve:
            <p>Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the Chicken Pad Kaprow to a serving platter. Garnish with extra Thai basil leaves if desired. Serve hot with steamed rice or your favorite side dishes.</p>
        </li>
